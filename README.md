## 🎯 Project Vision

### Overview
zkMed is the world's first **privacy-preserving healthcare insurance payment platform** that automates payments from insurers to hospitals and patients by leveraging cryptographically verifiable email proofs (vlayer MailProofs) and yield-generating liquidity pools built on **Merchant Moe Liquidity Book with custom hooks**. Built on Mantle Network with native mUSD integration and containerized production deployment.

### Core Innovation
**Web2/Web3 hybrid architecture** that maintains regulatory compliance while delivering revolutionary blockchain benefits:
- **Web2 Layer**: Traditional claim processing, medical review, regulatory compliance
- **Web3 Layer**: MailProof verification, instant payments, yield generation
- **Bridge**: DKIM-signed emails provide cryptographic proof without exposing medical data

### Current MVP Stage
- ✅ **Docker Environment**: Fully configured container orchestration with vlayer services
- ✅ **Smart Wallet Integration**: Working interaction with anvil-l2-mantle container  
- ✅ **Dynamic Address Resolution**: Client automatically connects to appropriate contract addresses
- ✅ **Dev Dashboard**: Basic interface showing container status and wallet connection at `/dev`

## 🔄 Hybrid Claim Processing Flow

### Web2/Web3 Integration Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Patient
    participant H as Hospital
    participant I as Insurer (Web2)
    participant V as vlayer
    participant LB as Merchant Moe Pool
    
    Note over P,I: Web2 Traditional Claim Processing
    P->>H: 1. Receive Medical Treatment
    H->>I: 2. Submit Claim via Portal/EHR
    I->>I: 3. Review & Assess Claim (Manual Process)
    I->>I: 4. Approve/Deny Decision
    
    Note over I,LB: Web3 Automated Payment Processing
    I->>H: 5. Send DKIM-Signed MailProof Email
    H->>V: 6. Submit MailProof for Verification
    V->>LB: 7. Trigger Pool Payment via Smart Contract
    LB->>H: 8. Instant mUSD Transfer to Hospital
    LB->>LB: 9. Distribute Yield to Stakeholders (60/20/20)
```

### Why Hybrid Architecture?
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Medical data stays in traditional systems (GDPR/HIPAA)
- **Industry Integration**: Seamless adoption without disrupting existing workflows
- **Privacy Protection**: Medical information never exposed on-chain
- **Instant Settlement**: Blockchain automation for immediate payment execution

## 🧪 Testing the Environment

### Verification Steps

```bash
# 1. Check all services are running
docker-compose ps

# 2. Verify Mantle fork is active
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8547

# 3. Test vlayer services
curl http://localhost:3000/health  # vlayer call server
curl http://localhost:7047         # notary server

# 4. Check frontend health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

### Smart Wallet Demo
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/dev
2. Connect wallet using thirdweb interface
3. Interact with deployed Greeting contract
4. Verify transaction on local Mantle fork

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports 3001, 8547, 3000, 7047 are available
- **Container Startup**: Wait for all dependencies before accessing frontend
- **Contract Deployment**: Check `docker logs zkmed-contracts` for deployment status

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Reset environment
make clean && make all

# Check specific service logs
docker logs anvil-l2-mantle
docker logs zkmed-frontend

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart zkmed-frontend
```
