## üéØ Project Vision

### Overview
zkMed is the world's first **privacy-preserving healthcare insurance payment platform** that automates payments from insurers to hospitals and patients by leveraging cryptographically verifiable email proofs (vlayer MailProofs) and [Chainlink Automation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation) for recurring payments. Built on Base with a seamless Privy wallet integration.

### Core Innovation
**Web2/Web3 hybrid architecture** that maintains regulatory compliance while delivering revolutionary blockchain benefits:
- **Web2 Layer**: Traditional claim processing, medical review, regulatory compliance
- **Web3 Layer**: MailProof verification, instant payments, automated processing
- **Bridge**: DKIM-signed emails provide cryptographic proof without exposing medical data

- **Domain Verification**: Cryptographic proof of organizational email control
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Complete medical privacy preservation
- **Audit Trails**: Complete email verification history for compliance

### Payment System
- **[Chainlink Automation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation)**: Scheduled monthly payment execution via `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` functions
- **zkMedLinkPay**: Smart contract implementing AutomationCompatibleInterface for recurring payments and fees
- **Payment Plans**: Verified by email proof between insurer and patient

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js with Server Components
- **Web3 Integration**: Privy SDK for seamless authentication

## üîÑ Hybrid Claim Processing Flow

### Web2/Web3 Integration Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Patient
    participant H as Hospital
    participant I as Insurer (Web2)
    participant V as vlayer
    participant C as Chainlink
    
    Note over P,I: Web2 Traditional Claim Processing
    P->>H: 1. Receive Medical Treatment
    H->>I: 2. Submit Claim via Portal/EHR
    I->>I: 3. Review & Assess Claim (Manual Process)
    I->>I: 4. Approve/Deny Decision
    
    Note over I,C: Web3 Automated Payment Processing
    I->>P: 5. Send DKIM-Signed Payment Plan Email
    P->>V: 6. Submit MailProof for Verification
    V->>C: 7. Setup Recurring Payment Schedule
    C->>H: 8. Execute Monthly Payments Automatically
```

### Why Hybrid Architecture?
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Medical data stays in traditional systems (GDPR/HIPAA)
- **Industry Integration**: Seamless adoption without disrupting existing workflows
- **Privacy Protection**: Medical information never exposed on-chain
- **Recurring Settlements**: Blockchain automation for scheduled payment execution
