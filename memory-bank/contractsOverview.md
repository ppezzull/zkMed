# zkMed Contracts Overview - Streamlined Web3 System Architecture

**Purpose**: Birds-eye view of every on-chain contract in the zkMed privacy-preserving healthcare platform with streamlined Web3 integrations including ERC-7824 abstract accounts, vlayer WebProofs/MailProofs, and thirdweb authentication.

---

## 🏗️ CONTRACT HIERARCHY & RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. EmailDomainProver.sol (vlayer Prover)

**Role**: Off-chain ZK engine that vlayer uses to verify institutional control of email domains and generate MailProofs.

**Core Function**: Inspects incoming emails (captured by vlayer's notaries), extracts "From:" address, target wallet (from subject), and domain, then builds ZK-proof showing:
1. Sender's `From:` address belonged to approved admin addresses (`admin@mountsinai.org`, `info@...`, etc.)
2. `Subject:` contained correct target wallet (`"Register organization Mount Sinai for 0x1234..."`)
3. Domain (`mountsinai.org`) was consistent across email's "From:" and JSON data

**Key Functions**:
- `verifyDomainOwnership(UnverifiedEmail calldata) → (Proof, domain, emailHash, targetWallet)`
- `verifyOrganization(UnverifiedEmail calldata) → (Proof, OrganizationVerificationData)`
- `simpleDomainVerification(UnverifiedEmail calldata, address) → (Proof, domain, emailHash)`

**Privacy Guarantee**: Prevents anyone from impersonating `admin@mountsinai.org`. Only genuine admin-sent emails yield valid ZK-proofs.
