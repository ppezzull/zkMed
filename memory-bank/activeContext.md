interface IHealthcareSmartAccount {
    // Premium payment with automatic conversion
    function payPremiumWithFiat(
        uint256 amount,
        string calldata currency,
        bytes calldata paymentData
    ) external;
    
    function payPremiumWithCrypto(
        uint256 amount,
        address token
    ) external;
    
    // Hybrid payment management
    function setupHybridPayments(
        PaymentPreferences calldata preferences
    ) external;
    
    function switchPaymentMethod(
        PaymentMethod newMethod
    ) external;
    
    // Yield and pool interaction
    function claimYield() external;
    function getEffectivePremiumCost() external view returns (uint256);
    function getYieldEarned() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

#### **thirdweb Payment Flow Integration**
```typescript
// Healthcare-specific thirdweb configuration
import { createThirdwebClient, prepareContractCall } from "thirdweb";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID,
});

// Premium payment with fiat conversion
const payPremiumWithFiat = async (amount: number, currency: string) => {
  const transaction = prepareContractCall({
    contract: healthcareContract,
    method: "payPremiumWithFiat",
    params: [amount, currency, paymentData],
  });
  
  // thirdweb handles fiat-to-crypto conversion automatically
  const result = await sendTransaction({
    transaction,
    account: smartAccount,
    payWithFiat: {
      currency,
      amount,
      autoConvert: true
    }
  });
  
  return result;
};

// Direct crypto payment
const payPremiumWithCrypto = async (amount: bigint) => {
  const transaction = prepareContractCall({
    contract: healthcareContract,
    method: "payPremiumWithCrypto",
    params: [amount, mUSDToken],
  });
  
  return sendTransaction({ transaction, account: smartAccount });
};
```

```typescript
// React component for unified premium payment
function PremiumPaymentInterface() {
  const [paymentMethod, setPaymentMethod] = useState<'fiat' | 'crypto' | 'hybrid'>('fiat');
  const [premiumAmount] = useState(100); // 100 mUSD monthly
  
  return (
    <div className="premium-payment-container">
      <PaymentMethodSelector 
        method={paymentMethod}
        onChange={setPaymentMethod}
      />
      
      {paymentMethod === 'fiat' && (
        <FiatPaymentForm
          amount={premiumAmount}
          onPayment={payPremiumWithFiat}
          supportedCurrencies={['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP']}
        />
      )}
      
      {paymentMethod === 'crypto' && (
