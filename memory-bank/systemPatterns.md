        bytes calldata hookData
    ) external override returns (bytes4) {
        // Validate patient registration and premium eligibility
        _validateHealthcarePremium(sender, params.liquidityConfigs);
        return LBBaseHooks.beforeMint.selector;
    }
    
    function beforeSwap(
        address sender,
        LBPair.PoolKey calldata key,
        ILBPair.SwapParams calldata params,
        bytes calldata hookData
    ) external override returns (bytes4) {
        // Validate MailProof and claim authorization
        _validateClaimAuthorization(hookData);
        return LBBaseHooks.beforeSwap.selector;
    }
    
    function afterSwap(
        address sender,

        BalanceDelta delta,
        bytes calldata hookData
    ) external override returns (bytes4) {
        // Distribute healthcare yield and update records
        _distributeHealthcareYield(delta);
        return LBBaseHooks.afterSwap.selector;
    }
}

  // Yield tracking across payment methods
  getPatientYieldHistory(patient: address): Promise<YieldRecord[]>;
}
```

#### **Enhanced Hospital Registration (MailProof-Verified)**
```typescript
interface IHospitalRegistration {
  // Domain-verified hospital registration
  registerHospitalWithDomain(
    mailProof: bytes,
    hospitalDetails: HospitalInformation,
    paymentWallet: address
  ): Promise<HospitalRecord>;
  
  // Claim processing integration
  setupClaimProcessing(
    hospital: address,
    systemIntegration: EHRIntegration
  ): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

#### **Insurer Pool Management**
```typescript
interface IInsurerPoolManagement {
  // Pool creation with custom healthcare hooks
  createHealthcarePool(
    insurer: address,
    poolParams: PoolConfiguration,
    hookConfig: HealthcareHookConfig
  ): Promise<PoolId>;
  
  // Patient relationship management
  addPatientToPool(
    poolId: PoolId,
    patient: address,
    policyTerms: PolicyConfiguration
  ): Promise<boolean>;
  
  // Performance monitoring
  getPoolMetrics(poolId: PoolId): Promise<PoolPerformanceMetrics>;
